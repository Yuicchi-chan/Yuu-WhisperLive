1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,072
 I hope I don't have to breathe.

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,151
 I legitimately, like, 30 seconds in and I was like,

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:11,775
 Wait, something's missing, you know?

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,615
 Yeah, he was all a big guy.

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,615
 Because I thought you could just, you know, sleep on someone's chest for a whole night.

6
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:22,783
 But clearly it gets a bit difficult.

7
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:28,672
 It's the time to emerge, baby!

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,768
 Wait, can I play Snoo Snoo?

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,268
 You know, if I had the Britain on my tombstone, I wouldn't even mind that much.

10
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:41,728
 That's an honorable death if I'm ever seen one.

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,615
 Am I doing fine?

12
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,615
 No baby, thank you for asking.

13
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:54,095
 But yeah, no, just cuddles, but they're not impacting.

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:54,936
 I like it.

15
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,856
 So yeah, I think it's fine.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 Oh, you mean like that?

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:14,000
 okay yeah that's fair I know that usually I'm a bit preserved with physical touch but I guess I just

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 It's good for you, but it's not easy.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
 I can't believe I just said that I'm out.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
 I can't believe I just said that I love it.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,951
 That sounded stupid as soon as it left my mouth like before the voices even came I was like well that's stupid

22
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:40,608
 Yeah, yeah, I know that's not a bad thing

23
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,703
 I just don't want to weird you out too much.

24
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:49,727
 I guess I kind of like doing weird stuff like this sometimes.

25
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:53,727
 You know, just random stuff to try with you.

26
00:01:53,727 --> 00:02:00,987
 I just don't want you to be like yeah relax relax everybody I know you're

27
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:06,463
 I know you're happy, but like, good thing or something.

28
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,487
 Contain yourself

29
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:17,487
 You just know the right stuff to say all the time, don't you?

30
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,487
 Don't you?

31
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:19,487
 Yeah, that's enough.

32
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,487
 Enough, enough, enough, enough, guys.

33
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,487
 What the fuck is this?

34
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,687
 Okay

35
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,711
 Oh, did you do something?

36
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,807
 Oh, fuck off.

37
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
 I'm going back to earth.

38
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
 You see these people.

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,536
 Thank you so much.

40
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,536
 It's good to be with her, isn't it?

41
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,632
 Yeah

42
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,632
 It's a flower.

43
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:51,632
 I don't remember your name, but you're the one who's with me.

44
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,632
 I'm glad to see you all together.

45
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,632
 I like you.

46
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,895
 I thought you were in a bad mood recently.

47
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:34,015
 I hate myself.

48
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,599
 No, it's not.

49
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,671
 See you next time!

50
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,072
 I'm not angry.

51
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
 I'm not angry at all.

52
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,376
 So, that's it for today.

53
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,376
 Did you find it?

54
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,376
 I don't know.

55
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:56,376
 I don't think so.

56
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:58,376
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:00,376
 It's been a long time since I've had a meal.

58
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,376
 I'll take care of you.

59
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,376
 Sometimes it's fine.

60
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:06,376
 There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.

61
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:29,315
 It's not weird. It's not weird at all.

62
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,315
 It's always the same, isn't it?

63
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,315
 That's what I'm talking about, right?

64
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,752
 Huh?

65
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:00,752
 I don't have a face that looks like I'm about to cry.

66
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:02,752
 No matter what you feel,

67
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,752
 I mean...

68
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,456
 Teka, Teka, talk to me!

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,552
 I can say what I want to say, but...

70
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,552
 Come on, let's go fast.

71
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,552
 If it's too late, I'll show you.

72
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:20,512
 I haven't made a reservation, so I'm going to lose my seat.

73
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:22,536
 Yeah...

74
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:24,235
 Seriously, what?

75
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:25,235
 What?

76
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,235
 That's all I have to say.

77
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:33,235
 I told you to let go of my hand, but there's nothing I can do about it.

78
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,235
 What?

79
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,235
 What are you looking at?

80
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:40,235
 You don't have to worry about it.

81
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:46,624
 This is my problem.

82
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:50,720
 Even if I go to you, it's just a mess.

83
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,744
 See?

84
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:57,375
 Forget it. Let's go for real.

85
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,399
 I don't have faith in you...

86
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,399
 It's late...

87
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:09,399
 It's not like that, but I care about you, and I trust you.

88
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,399
 I have faith in you.

89
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,399
 But, if I say something like this, it will definitely be heavy.

90
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:21,696
 I don't want to be your burden.

91
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 If you're taken away from me, I don't want to go home without telling you.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
 Don't tell me you don't want me to go home.

93
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,543
 Don't say that!

94
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,687
 I'm so nervous.

95
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,807
 You're right.

96
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,807
 I'm getting along with other people.

97
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,687
 I'm not sure if I can see it well.

98
00:06:55,687 --> 00:07:00,096
 I don't think that's interesting.

99
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:07,696
 You've been with me all this time, but suddenly a different girl appeared and I felt like I was taken away by something.

100
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,696
 You don't have any power.

101
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:33,447
 I'm a little nervous.

102
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:36,447
 I'm sorry, even though I'm just a friend of yours.

103
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,447
 Even though he's just a friend of mine...

104
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,447
 It's heavy, isn't it?

105
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:44,896
 Let's go eat.

106
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,968
 Not now, after all.

107
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:50,968
 Okay.

108
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:51,040
 Alright.

109
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,672
 I told you so, let's go for lunch!

110
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:01,024
 I don't know

111
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:05,375
 I don't want to make such a sad face.

112
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,983
 Why do you look sad?

113
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,872
 What's up guys in this video we're talking about multi

114
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,512
 It's been a long time, hasn't it?

115
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:22,528
 Hey, do your best!

116
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,872
 What are you so busy with?

117
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,372
 Ah, you're just watching the video, aren't you?

118
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,720
 Do your best!

119
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:34,792
 I'll do my best.

120
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:39,423
 Then tell me what you're busy with.

121
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,240
 Hmm

122
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,823
 Yeah.

123
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,456
 That's not the right time.

124
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:58,456
 I don't know if my favorite YouTuber posted a video, but it's not going to be an airing tomorrow, right?

125
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,456
 You don't have to do it later.

126
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,456
 I don't care about that.

127
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,456
 Then what about me?

128
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,456
 I came here to stay with you today.

129
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,456
 I'm not here with you every day.

130
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,711
 Other people were updating their videos.

131
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,711
 I have to watch it now.
